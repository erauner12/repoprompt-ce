# Director Mode — Standing Decision Record

Recreated 2026-07-06 after the untracked `docs/plans/mock-parity-2026-07-05.md` and
`docs/plans/coordinator-mock-overhaul-2026-07-06.md` were lost to a worktree recreation
(they were gitignored). **This file is tracked on purpose.** Durable decisions live here;
ephemeral run charters may stay in `docs/plans/` but must cite this record.

## 1. Fidelity principles (LOCKED)
- **Mock for structure, Agent Mode for temperature.** The HTML mock
  (`reference/RepoPrompt_Command_Center.html`) is authoritative for layout, anatomy, copy,
  and interaction. Agent Mode is authoritative for palette, chip severity, and accent
  economy. `CoordinatorTheme` anchors to system materials; color is reserved for semantic
  state (amber = needs-you, red = genuine failure, green = done, blue = running/live);
  metadata chips are neutral; card kickers are neutral label + status dot.
- **Layout contract (four states).** Draft = rail + full-width center draft surface +
  composer, no right pane. Mission-without-plan = rail + conversation, no right pane
  (no-plan strip lives inside the conversation). Mission-with-plan = rail + conversation +
  Mission Plan pane (header: title + status + collapse; no segmented pickers). Board =
  rail + full-width center board, no composer, no right pane. Any deviation is a spec
  change, not an implementation choice.
- Plan-node clicks never open the inspector (highlight only; info lives on the card).
  The inspector remains exclusively for Agent Board rows.

## 2. Deliberate divergences from the mock (each needs a future mock-sync pass)
- Header `Stop / Clear` removed — composer stop is canonical; Clear conflicts with
  ledger-is-history doctrine.
- Neutral palette / chip discipline (see §1) supersedes the mock's colorful chips, which
  were legibility scaffolding in an HTML artifact.
- Composer `Permissions` chip removed from the Director surface (see §3) — in the mock it
  was ported theater from Agent Mode with no defined Director behavior.

## 3. Policy ownership model (LOCKED 2026-07-06)
- **One picker: the draft-surface policy grid.** The composer policy popover
  (`CoordinatorMissionPolicyPopoverView` behind the "Permissions" chip) duplicated the
  picker with internal ask-class vocabulary and a colliding name; it is removed from the
  Director composer.
- **Lifecycle:** policy library (named definitions; built-ins now, "Edit a copy" CRUD
  deferred) → draft-time selection on the grid → captured at send as provider-only
  metadata → runtime records `policy_snapshot` on the Mission Plan → **the mission owns
  its snapshot**, decoupled from the library thereafter → mid-mission adjustments are the
  dials only (pace; `Me|Director` childAsk when it lands) through the app-owned
  `missionPlanUpdater` seam — never a re-pick, never a re-send.
- **Mission Templates are orthogonal.** Policy = "how much stops for you" (never shape);
  Template = "what kind of work" (never trust). The one coupling: a template MAY carry a
  *recommended* policy pointer that pre-selects the grid but never locks it. `▸ Try:`
  chips are inline templates and the reference pattern:
  `MissionTemplate = { directive text, optional recommended-policy ref, optional shape hint }`.
- **Vocabulary:** "Permissions" is reserved for run-level permissions (the Agent Mode
  concept). Director says "Mission Policy" exclusively. A per-mission run-permission
  preset for delegated children is a recorded deferral, not a feature.
- **Policy library roadmap (LOCKED 2026-07-06 — custom policies: yes, staged).**
  *Why:* a policy is a named, reusable trust envelope — the encoding of earned trust for a
  recurring kind of mission (mission-is-the-unit: recurring kinds → recurring envelopes;
  the name survives into ledger and receipt as the one-word trust story).
  *Stage 0 (done):* four built-ins + snapshot-at-draft + single picker.
  *Stage 1 (scheduled):* the two dials (pace; `Me|Director` via `missionPlanUpdater`) —
  per-mission adjustment without library writes.
  *Stage 2 (custom policies):* primary affordance is **"Save as policy"** from a mission's
  captured snapshot (policies are born from lived missions, not blank forms); secondary is
  "Edit a copy" from a built-in. Both open one minimal editor: name · pace · per-class
  ask/auto in human display names (F3 vocabulary rule applies) · cap · guidance. Storage
  mirrors `CoordinatorMissionTemplateStore`; customs join the grid; built-ins immutable;
  snapshot doctrine already guarantees library edits never touch running missions.
  *Never build:* policy-per-node (the envelope is mission-scoped), per-repo auto-selection
  rules, sharing/marketplace. Templates compose via the recommended-policy pointer only.
  *Timing:* behind the screenshot parity pass + demo; ~two focused runs (store/model,
  then editor UI).
- **Autonomy control model — three layers (LOCKED 2026-07-06).** The levers differ in
  scope and must look like it:
  *Layer 1 — Policy (noun, picked once):* the named stance chosen on the draft grid;
  rendered everywhere as the name.
  *Layer 2 — Dials (standing adjustments, exactly two):* pace (`Step|Auto`) and
  `Me|Director` (childAsk). Dials write **mission-level overrides onto the snapshot** via
  `missionPlanUpdater` — never mutate the library policy, never re-send metadata. When a
  dial diverges from the named policy, the name must say so: echo becomes
  **"Policy · Default · edited (pace → Auto)"** — a preset name may never lie. ("Save as
  policy" attaches here in Stage 2.) Application semantics, one rule stated in UI help and
  here: **dial changes apply from the next boundary; a pending checkpoint is never
  consumed** (toggles configure, buttons act). Every mid-run dial change posts a ledger
  line ("You set pace → Auto for this mission") so scope is self-evident and audited.
  Current-code gap (recon 2026-07-06): pace exists *only* inside the policy snapshot — no
  composer pace variable, no mission-level override channel; the dial must gain the
  override path rather than binding to the preset's field.
  *Layer 3 — Moment buttons (one-time acts):* checkpoint triad, gate approval, overrule —
  always act once, never configure. Visual grammar: dials are segmented toggles, moment
  acts are buttons; the two never share styling.
  *Legibility rule:* the contract shows where it bites — at boundaries/strip, derive a
  dynamic preview from the autonomy map × the ready set ("Auto continues: launch 2 ready
  steps · Stops for: merge (irreversible)"). *Trust loop:* the wrap-up stat card may
  suggest encoding ("Decided itself 7×, no overrules — save these settings as a policy /
  try Hands-off for missions like this").

## 3a. CHARTER — Dial override channel (dispatch-ready; explicit; supersedes nothing)

**Intent: the `Step|Auto` dial is KEPT, exactly as prominent and dynamic as today. This
charter gives it (and `Me|Director`) a real data path. Do not remove, relocate, or
de-emphasize either dial. Any instruction that reads otherwise is a misreading.**

1. **Composer state.** Add `missionPaceSelection` (and `childAskSelection`) to the
   composer VM. Initialize: draft → from the selected grid policy
   (`defaultPace` / `autonomy[childAsk-key]`); mission selected → from
   `plan.policySnapshot`. **[verify]** the exact childAsk autonomy-class key string used
   by the runtime; use it verbatim.
2. **Draft capture honesty.** `policyProviderLines` (VM ~406) must read the **effective**
   values — `Default pace:` from the dial selection, `Autonomy:` childAsk from the dial —
   not the raw policy fields. What the runtime records as `policy_snapshot` therefore
   equals what the user configured at send.
3. **Mid-run write path.** Dial change on a mission with a recorded plan →
   `missionPlanUpdater` mutation setting `policySnapshot.defaultPace`
   (resp. `autonomy[childAsk-key]`), with revision bump — **and a user-actor decision
   record** with fixed labels: "set pace to Auto" / "set pace to Step" /
   "routed child questions to Me" / "routed child questions to the Director". Wave 2.5's
   ledger→transcript projection then renders the audit echo automatically; build nothing
   extra for display.
4. **Semantics guardrails.** A dial change never consumes a pending checkpoint
   (held-checkpoint invariant — add the test if absent). It sends no steer and no
   metadata; the runtime picks it up at the next boundary via `mission_status`
   (fingerprint moves on mutation). **[verify]** `defaultPace` participates in the compact
   policy fingerprint part; if absent, add it (one line + one test).
5. **`edited` honesty marker.** Pure computed comparison of the snapshot's
   {pace, childAsk} against the library policy bearing `policySnapshot.id`. When they
   differ: composer echo and plan-pane policy chip render
   **"Policy · {name} · edited"** (tooltip lists the diffs, e.g. "pace → Auto"). No stored
   flag; built-ins are the comparison base today, custom policies by the same id lookup
   later. This is Stage 2's future "Save as policy" attachment point — do not build that
   button now.
6. **Prompt check.** Confirm `AgentModePrompts` states the policy snapshot may change
   mid-mission and is re-read at each boundary; add one sentence if absent. No MCP
   protocol changes in this charter.
7. **Tests.** (a) draft: dial flip → provider metadata carries effective pace/childAsk;
   (b) mid-run: dial flip → snapshot mutated, revision + compact fingerprint advance,
   user-actor decision recorded with the exact fixed label; (c) a pending checkpoint
   survives a dial flip; (d) `edited` true/false matrix incl. flip-back-to-preset →
   marker clears; (e) childAsk key round-trips through mission_status.
8. **Out of scope.** Per-class autonomy menu, custom policy CRUD, a cap dial, any
   checkpoint-anatomy changes, the boundary contract-preview, the wrap-up suggestion
   (those are separate items in §3).

## 3b. Autonomy extensibility (LOCKED 2026-07-06): the map is the mechanism
The autonomy map (`class → ask|auto`, unknown resolves to Ask) **is** the extensible
mechanism — new classes are one key + one prompt sentence + policy updates, with zero
schema risk. No generalized per-class control surface is built. **Graduation rule:** a
new class enters ask-by-default with a human display name and joins the policy
definitions; it earns a dial only if real usage shows it is flexed mid-mission (dial
count discipline: two today, three ever, absent strong evidence). **One structural
investment (opportunistic, cheap):** an `AutonomyClass` registry — key, display name,
one-line human description, default — centralizing vocabulary now scattered across
prompts, policies, and ask-summary strings; it feeds grid copy, echo lines, the Stage 2
editor, and the future boundary contract-preview. The general editing surface remains
Stage 2's minimal editor, reached via "Save as policy" — from lived experience, never
speculation.

## 4. Decisions queue doctrine + identity (LOCKED)
- The queue contains **asks — things waiting on the user — only**: pending child
  interactions, pending checkpoints, held boundaries. Blocked nodes/sessions are never
  queue items unless they carry a pending interaction; scheduler stalls are
  `liveness_warnings` telemetry, never queue entries.
- Identity: child interaction → its own UUID; checkpoint → deterministic UUID from
  `(missionID, checkpointKind, planRevision)` via `CoordinatorMissionStableIdentity`
  (a re-approval after revision is a NEW item by construction); held boundary →
  `(missionID, "held-checkpoint", planRevision)`.
- Ordering: **oldest-first FIFO, no urgency tiers** (attention ranking is the user's
  judgment; the queue is honest, not clever). Badge = pending count, never ledger size,
  never telemetry.

## 5. W1/W2 content-review gate — PASSED (2026-07-06 @ a131f2dc)
Resume-directive eligibility instruction present and test-asserted; flight cap counts
**running nodes** (`denyFlightCapReached`, default 3) uniformly across run/explore starts
including pre-approval probes; compact `mission_status` carries per-node `deps_satisfied`
+ top-level `ready_node_ids`; the compact fingerprint carries both **explicitly**
(edge-only revisions advance `wait_for_update`); `eligible_nodes_idle` documents its
transient-fire window as telemetry. The `running N/cap` chip reads
`MissionPlanReadinessProjection.runningNodeCount` — UI and scheduler agree on the node as
the unit. Follow-up (non-blocking): the ready-set rule exists twice (view projection +
MCP helper); extract a shared `CoordinatorMissionPlanScheduling` helper when either is
next touched.

## 6. Calm Law + K-pass charter (LOCKED 2026-07-06) — attention hierarchy as layout

**The law (the queue doctrine applied to pixels): show what needs you; summarize what is
running; collapse what is done.** The screen is an attention queue — one loud thing
maximum, ambient state quiet, history folded. Diagnosis from live screenshots: identical
facts render 3–5× per screen; every entry is a bordered card; plan events spam the
transcript; raw session IDs wear chips; two composers coexist on completed missions.

**Principles:**
1. **One home per fact.** If a fact renders twice on one screen, one instance is wrong.
   Canonical homes: plan structure/objective → right pane only (the in-conversation plan
   card becomes a one-line reference: "Mission Plan · r7 → view"); policy/pace/cap →
   strip only; counts → strip rollup only. The receipt keeps its archival copy but
   renders collapsed (stat line + expand).
2. **Attention tiers.** Tier 1 (loud, max ONE): the active checkpoint/question — siblings
   dim while one exists. Tier 2 (ambient): strip rollup + running node lines. Tier 3
   (collapsed by default): completed parts fold to one line ("Part 1 · done · 1 ✓",
   expandable); done nodes drop their chips; the receipt folds to its stat line.
3. **Prose over cards.** Director prose renders unboxed (Agent Mode's grammar). Cards are
   reserved for: checkpoints, one per delegated session (updating **in place** — its
   status line absorbs bound/completed events), evidence verdicts, the receipt.
   **Event coalescing:** Plan Session-bound / Node-completed / Revised rows collapse into
   the session card's status or a single "Plan updated · r6→r7" line.
4. **Chip budget: ≤2 per row, semantic-state only, never raw IDs** (session identity is a
   link, not a chip; fix the duplicated "Read-only child ×2" rendering). Done-state rows
   carry zero chips.
5. **One composer at a time.** The plan-revision composer exists only when the pane is
   open AND the mission is active; completed missions show a single "Start a follow-up
   Mission…" composer and nothing else. **Completed is the calmest state**: wrap-up card
   + collapsed receipt + a "transcript" disclosure — a finished mission must look
   *quieter* than a running one.

**K-pass (staged, each its own small run):** K1 deduplicate (plan reference card, strip
ownership, delete the mission-context card — its facts live in strip + grounding,
collapse receipt); K2 coalesce events + in-place session cards; K3 chip budget + ID
removal; K4 tiering/collapse + unboxed prose + checkpoint dimming; K5 composer
exclusivity + completed-state calm. **Acceptance:** the count test — the current
completed-mission screenshot's facts in ≤⅓ the visual elements — plus the squint rule
above. **K6 (runtime UX note):** the generic fallback approval plan that precedes the
first real decomposition should render as a "Drafting the plan…" state, not a full plan
card that gets replaced — suppress the plan card until the first substantive revision.

**K1 — ACCEPTED (2026-07-06, live-verified).** Completed-mission center = summary +
folded transcript; terminal status wins over stale approval; mission-context card gone.
Residual carried into K3: the plan pane duplicates itself (pane header vs. inner card
both render "Mission Plan"/status; policy renders twice within one block) — fold so the
pane header row IS the strip and the inner card loses its duplicate header/chips.

**K3 — EXPANDED: the Signal Shape System (supersedes "chip budget"; user-derived).**
Uniform shape flattens the signal hierarchy: when every fact is a capsule, no capsule
can claim attention. Encode information class in form —
*State* (mission/node status, needs-you): the ONLY filled capsules; max one per row.
*Counts* (`2/2 done`, `running 0/3`): plain text — numbers self-signal.
*Metadata* (policy · edited · pace · cap · workflow · role): one muted interpunct text
line, no borders (e.g. `Default · edited · auto · cap 3`).
*Identity* (sessions, nodes): text links, never chips; no raw ID fragments anywhere;
fix the duplicated "Read-only child ×2" rendering.
Rule: **a capsule is a claim on attention** — scarcity is the feature; the amber
`needs you` pill must be visually alone in its class. Applies to strip, part headers,
node rows, transcript cards, and receipt alike.

**K7 — Inspector eviction (NEW, per user review).** The inspector never renders inside
the Mission Plan pane. A plan node's bound session is a **link** (one tap → Open Agent);
the inspector exists only alongside the Board (its H4 home), and receives the calm
anatomy (no key-value debug rows) in a later polish pass.

**Focus order:** K3(expanded) → K7 → K2 → K4 → K5.

**K3/K7 — ACCEPTED (2026-07-06, live-verified).** Signal Shape System formalized as a
typed mapping in `CoordinatorMissionPresentationPolicy` (`SignalFactClass → SignalShape`);
mission-pane inspector evicted; Board inspector collapses to a side rail. Carried flag →
**K7b:** the Board inspector's *inner* anatomy is still key-value debug rows; give it the
calm treatment in a later pass.

**K8 — State-conditional calm (from the 2026-07-06 computer-use audit): controls and
emphasis must respond to mission state.** Extend `CoordinatorMissionPresentationPolicy`
with pure, tested functions (`composerMode(for:)`, `paneEmphasis(for:)`,
`boardColumnEmphasis(for:)`, `railRowSignal(for:)`):
- **K8a — Terminal composer.** Completed/stopped missions never show the full composer
  (dials, policy echo, stop are live-mission controls and contradict finality). Replace
  with ONE quiet action — "Start a follow-up Mission →" — which reveals the full composer
  only on explicit intent. **Absorbs K5.**
- **K8b — Right-pane emphasis.** Exactly one status capsule, in the pane header. Plan
  body neutral; evidence on Done nodes collapses to an expandable "Evidence ✓" line;
  green exists only as the state capsule, never as tinted text blocks.
- **K8c — Board de-rainbow.** Columns become neutral containers; color lives only in the
  header dot + count. Empty columns dim (reduced opacity, header retained) but keep their
  positions — no layout jumping.
- **K8d — Rail signal.** Terminal mission rows use muted-text status, no filled capsule;
  rail capsules are reserved for live / needs-you rows so current work is visually
  distinct from history by form, not just position.

**Audit finding #4 (policy grid before intent) — DEFERRED.** It would reverse the
accepted, mock-locked C3 draft surface, whose grid is the demo's teaching surface ("your
words choose the shape; policy chooses stops"). Captured kernel for later: *progressive
familiarity* — after the user's first few missions, the grid may default-collapse to the
summary row with the four-card chooser on demand. Revisit post-demo.

**Focus order (updated):** K8 → K2 (event coalescing — matters for *running* missions,
which K1's completed-state folding doesn't touch) → K4 remainder (unboxed Director prose,
checkpoint dimming) → K7b (calm inspector anatomy).

**K8 — ACCEPTED (2026-07-06, live-verified).** Terminal follow-up action, single pane
capsule, folded evidence, neutral board columns, muted rail history — all landed with
presentation-policy tests.

**K9 — Demo-polish run (bang-for-buck ranking toward the demo video):**
1. **K2 executes now** — the running transcript is where demo eyes live; four stacked
   Plan event rows per worker completion fold into the in-place session card + one
   "Plan updated · rN→rM" line.
2. **Narration vocabulary (bundle with K2):** the runtime's own prose is the last
   internals leak ("Policy snapshot is Auto with childAsk auto…"). One `AgentModePrompts`
   sentence: narrate in human terms, never autonomy class keys. Also tuck `r7` revision
   jargon into metadata form.
3. **K4-lite:** unbox Director prose (Agent Mode's grammar).
4. **Stage the demo mission:** the parallel fan-out story (two independent chains →
   converging review; `running 2/3`; `Waiting on A ✓ · B …` ticking; auto-pickup on the
   second parent; evidence; receipt) — W1's on-camera moment. One dry run doubles as the
   outstanding seven-state screenshot pass; record after.

## 7. Open deferrals (recorded, not holes)
- Custom policy CRUD — designed and staged; see §3 "Policy library roadmap" ("Save as
  policy" primary, "Edit a copy" secondary, minimal editor, post-parity timing).
- Per-class autonomy menu; `Me|Director` dial ships via the `missionPlanUpdater` seam.
- Policy snapshot **drift guard** (compare sent policy vs runtime-recorded snapshot on
  first publish; pure projection).
- Probe loop-iteration transcript beats (runtime contract addition).
- Child-question suggested-answer contract.
- Per-mission run-permission preset for delegated children.
- Soft dependency edges, node priority, mission backlog tiers, `failed` node status
  (decode-compat), `CoordinatorMissionRoutingOperation` closed-enum forward-compat
  strategy before any new operation is added.

## 8. coordinator_chat extension roadmap (2026-07-07, harness-driven)

Rule: extend for **observation** and **user-channel parity** only; never new runtime
powers. Additions stay additive ops.

1. **`mission_events since=<seq>`** — sequenced transition journal, likely an in-memory
   ring buffer per mission. This removes the polling-race class that forced S2 to accept
   ready/running/completed convergence snapshots; once landed, the harness can assert the
   exact transition order and power run bundles / `--watch`.
2. **User-action parity: `set_pace` / `set_autonomy`** — route through the same
   `missionPlanUpdater` path as the dials: same revision bump and same user-actor
   decision labels. **Actor-integrity gate required:** hide these ops from
   coordinator-role sessions via advertisement policy and block them at execution in
   `AgentModeMCPToolPolicy`; the runtime must not be able to forge user-actor records.
3. **`receipt format=markdown`** — expose the existing pure receipt projection so the
   harness can write `receipt.md` without UI copying.
4. **Lifecycle: `list_missions` / `archive_mission`** — support harness setup/teardown
   and scenario isolation.
5. **`doctor`** (later) — app-level pulse: supervisor alive, pending events, last
   fingerprint age, connected clients.

Not doing: `mission_status` field selectors, which fragment the contract; any
plan-structure mutation outside the existing mission-plan path.
